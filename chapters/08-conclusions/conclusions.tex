\label{08-conclusions-outlook}

- To truly handle unlimited datasets, two directions could be pursued:
  - setting up a backend server, most likely some sort of database with an API
  - Refactoring the front-end code to embed the server and client code together as a cross-platform desktop app e.g. Electron.
  - Choosing something javascript-based like electron capitalizes on the investment in Javascript code for the front-end

\section{Conclusion}
\label{08-conclusions-conclusion}

- It worked
- Browsers have a hard limit to the size of datasets they can ingest, which is one advantage of using a client/server approach.
- The client-side approach has proven useful and successful in many situations
