I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Kai Nagel for offering me the opportunity to work in this exciting field of research, and for his valuable advice and guidance throughout each stage of this dissertation.

My thanks also go to Andrea Stillarius, Nadja Dautel and Jakub Wilk for their constant administrative and technical assistance. I would also like to thank the staff members at the Institute of Mathematics who maintained the compute servers.

I thank Aaron Tatar, Santi Rodriguez, Elizabeth Sall, Zabe Bent, Rob Dietrich, and Nicolas Borg for their encouragement, deep patience, and sound advice throughout this research.

I stand on the shoulders of giants who created all of the open source software used in the development of this dissertation, too numerous to count.

Last but not least, I am greatly indebted to my family, in particular to my sisters Suzan and Sonya for emotional support, and to my parents Bob and Tez Charlton, for buying a very expensive Atari 800 home computer ``for the family'' when I was eleven years old, which set me on a lifelong path of technological discovery.
