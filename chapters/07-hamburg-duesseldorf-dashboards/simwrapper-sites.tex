Augmenting or replacing fixed-route transit lines with automated, connected, shared taxi fleets may be a desirable alternative for transit agencies in less-densely developed areas. The economics of fixed-route transit are difficult to square with sparse development patterns, especially with the advent of private ride-hailing services which add the "shared taxi" concept to people's travel options \cite{Hough2018}. The same technologies used by private ride-hailing, however, can also be modified and applied to future transit services.
