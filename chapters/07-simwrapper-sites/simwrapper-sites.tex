\section{Introduction}
\label{07-simwrapper-sites-intro}

In this chapter three implementation sites using the SimWrapper platform are described in detail.

\section{HH Hamburg}
\label{07-simwrapper-sites-hamburg}

\section{KOMOD-Next}
\label{07-simwrapper-sites-komodnext}

New functionality for site branding: custom headers, footers, and section navigation

\section{ActivitySim}
\label{07-simwrapper-sites-activitysim}

Consortium of multiple regions of the U.S. are evaluating use of SimWrapper for development of standard dashboards for their common activity-based model.

\section{Discussion and Outlook}
\label{07-simwrapper-sites-discussion}

- The flexibility of SimWrapper allowed development of nice interactive sites
- Branding and "hiding" of SimWrapper itself such as the logo, navigation, helped agencies use the tool in public settings
- Better documentation and examples critical to adoption
- Initial ramp-up and publishing are not without friction. Need improvement

\section{Summary}
\label{07-simwrapper-sites-summary}

- This chapter describes three different implementations of SimWrapper, two at VSP and one external.
- Sites successfully used in public settings
- Feedback was that learning curve was steep, and rollout (non-VSP) was difficult
- New production options such as Docker and SPA/static developed in response.
- Documentation is always a challenge
