\section{EXPERIMENTAL}\label{experimental}}

\emph{We are currently researching the best way to ingest the very large
MATSim event files in a streaming manner, in order to produce useful
animations or other visualizations from them.}

\emph{Currently, we can load an} \texttt{output\_events.xml.gz}
\emph{file but it takes a very long time (many minutes for a typical
simulation), and then the vehicle animation displays but does not yet
have any configuration.}

\emph{This is a technology test; feel free to try it out. We will
hopefully update it to be more featureful soon.}

\hypertarget{usage}{%
\subsection{Usage}\label{usage}}

If the file \texttt{output\_events.xml.gz} exists in a folder, the
events viewer panel will be available. There is no YAML configuration
available.

Event animations cannot be embedded in a dashboard.
