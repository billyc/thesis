# PART I: CLIENT-SERVER DATA VISUALIZATION FOR MICROSIMULATION RESULTS

## 1. Explorations of data visualization techniques in support of the MATSim microsimulation

Server-based experiments:

- user interface research
- Accessibility (Kenya)
- SNF Switzerland model (flows)
- Emissions: level-of-detail

## 2. MatHub: A server-based data visualization platform for MATSim

- import MatHub paper in its entirety
  - **Paper:** Web-based Data Visualization Platform for MATSim (2020)

# PART II: PROJECT SITES USING CLIENT-SIDE DATA VISUALIZATION TECHNIQUES

## 3 COVID-SIM: Direct browser-based data visualition

Then COVID happened.

- What was wrong with the server-based system?
- throwing out the server to accelerate everything
- Covid site chapter.

## 4 AVÖV

  - - **Paper:** Open-Source Web-Based Visualizer for Dynamic-Response Shared Taxi Simulations (2021)

## 5 PAVE

- More on PAVE

# PART III: A GENERALIZED BROWSER-BASED DATA VISUALIZATION PLATFORM

## 6 SimWrapper

- Three repeated efforts in building project-specific sites
- After doing it three times
- Based on user feedback, time to make it generic

## 7 Project sites built using SimWrapper

- HH Hamburg
- KoMo:Dnext
- MATSim Generic dashboard
